# Rainfall

Rainfall is the compiler for the Thrice language.

Transpiles the Thrice source to C.

This is the version of the Rainfall written in Rust. Eventually, it will be
rewritten in Thrice.

---

## Usage

Loads all the Thrice packages in the workspace directory. Transpile executable
packages to a single C file with an entry point.

`rainfall (-(-<option>|<option_shortcut>) <value>?)* <command>|<command_shortcut> <argument>*`

After the executable name, there should be zero or more options, which come
after two dashes and might expect a value after them. The shortcut for an option
can only be used with a single dash before it.

Then, there should be the command. The shortcut for a command can be directly
used in its place.

After the command, there could be zero or more arguments passed to the command.
